## About me :)
I am currently a 3rd year at UCSB studying Statistic and Data Science & Biochemistry--Molecular Biology. I am most excited to face the intersection between technology and biology/medicine through developing machine learning and AI models in order to expand the possibilities of human capabilities. Overall, I am driven to build technical skills that enhance human life in meaningful ways, whether through direct biological applications or broader technological innovations.
